# Light-Year-Wars-C
A replica of the Adobe Flash game "Light Year Wars" by Nico Tuason.

Written in C with OpenGL. Requires various Windows and OpenGL header files.

Run `make -B` to compile both the server and client executables.

I used GCC from [WinLibs](https://winlibs.com/) when writing the code, 
so it's probably the best place to look if your version of GCC is erroring when
trying to run make.
The specific GCC version as printed when I run `gcc --version` is
```
gcc.exe (MinGW-W64 i686-msvcrt-posix-dwarf, built by Brecht Sanders, r5) 15.2.0
```
